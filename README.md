# APT-interface

A python module to interface lab equipment that communicate with the Thorlab APT protocol

# Installation

> The pypi package is not published yet, it will be soon

The package is based on the library [pyftdi](https://github.com/eblot/pyftdi) which uses `libusb 1.x` as a native dependency and thus should be installed.

## Windows

The easiest way is to install [zadig](https://zadig.akeo.ie/) (it will detect ftdi device automatically)

## Linux

```bash
apt-get install libusb-1.0
```

### udev rules configuration

Udev rules need to be created to communicate with devices without using administrator privilege.
A special `11-ftdi.rules` is available in the `rules` directory (it might be necessary to adapt it if you want to use different devices than mine), you can copy it to `/etc/udev/rules.d` and run the following command as root :

```bash
udevadm control --reload-rules
udevadm trigger
```


Finally, run the following command to install my package (install from source for now).
```bash
pip install apt-interface
```

# Usage

The package is composed for now of 4 differents files and modules:
 - `device.py` with class `Device` a low level communication class with APT devices
 - `KPZ101.py` with class `KPZ101` and `KPZ101Config` a module with multiple function to control KPZ101 devices
 - `KSG101.py` with class `KSG101` and `KSG101Config` a module with multiple function to control KSG101 devices
 - `scan.py` with class `Scan` and `ScanConfig` a module to generate coordinates and follow them with a KPZ101 device

## Simple example

### Configuration

Here is a simple configuration for a KPZ device

```yaml
name: X_axis_controller
serial_nm: "29501986"
baudrate: 115200
mode: closed_loop
feedback_in: chann2
voltage_limit: 75 
```

### Usage

```python
from apt_interface.KPZ101 import KPZ101

with KPZ101(config_file="config_KPZ.yaml") as kpz:
    print(kpz.conf)
    print(kpz.get_info())
    kpz.identify() # Should make the screen of the specified KPZ blink

    print("Warning High Voltage")
    kpz.enable_output()
    kpz.set_output_voltage(20) # The KPZ needs to be configured in open_loop for voltage control
```

Feel free to create pull requests and add support for other devices, i will try my best to review the code and merge changes in time! You can as well add issues for any problem you encounter with implemented functions.
